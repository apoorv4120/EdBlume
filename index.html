                <div class="story-bio">
                    <p class="story-excerpt">We started EdBlume with a single, powerful realization: something essential was missing in our schools—the emotional well-being of those who live and learn within them. After decades in classrooms and leadership roles, we witnessed the quiet cracks in the system.</p>
                    <div class="story-full">
                        <p>Teachers overwhelmed by deadlines. Substitution teachers burdened with extra syllabus coverage when regular teachers were on leave. Neurodiverse learners struggling to keep pace in classrooms not built for their needs. Parents feeling helpless. Teachers silently exhausted. And students—especially those who needed support the most—falling further behind. Not out of negligence, but because the system kept moving, too fast to stop and care.</p>
                        <p>EdBlume was born to address these challenges, to slow things down and bring human values back into education, to support those who teach, uplift those who learn differently, and remind everyone that no child should be left behind—not because of a system's pace, but in spite of it. Because when we nurture the emotional lives of teachers and students, we don't just improve learning….we transform lives.</p>
